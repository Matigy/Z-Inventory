Prelim Project Repository for our CCS107 - Data Structures And Algorithms. 

Each groups were tasked to create a simple console-based zoo inventory tracking system that can store up to 50 animals. 
The program should allow zookeepers to: 

- Add new animal records (name, species, age, enclosure number 0â€“4).
- View all registered animals. 
- Search animals by name to see details. 
- Count animals by species. 
- Display animals in a specific enclosure.
